               Memcachedb-based persistent storage
               -----------------------------------

This is an experimental prototype for opencog persistence, making use
of the memcache API, and the memcachedb daemon. 

Actually, its a pre-proptotype, nothing works yet.

Installation
------------
Need to install "memcachedb". This is a very simple database server that
talks the memcached protocol. The "start-db-server.sh" is a simple shell
to start the server. Edit this script as nmeeded. In particular, change
the database name, as needed.

Testing the install
-------------------
The "sniff.cc" program provides a very simple example of programming with
the memcached API. This rpogram should run and work correctly.
