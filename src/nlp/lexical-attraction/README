This directory contains a prototype implementation of Yuret's "lexical
attraction" algorithm for the discovery of synatctic links between
words in a sentence (Yuret 1998). The goal of this algorithm is to 
provide a score for ranking the output of the link-grammar parser.

So far, nothing has been implemented; this is a pre-prototype.




Misc comments
-------------

A classic parse-ranking example is given in the following sentence.
Both parses are more or less legitimate, and have valid interpretations.

(S (NP I) (VP saw (NP the man) (PP with (NP the telescope))) .)

(S (NP I) (VP saw (NP (NP the man) (PP with (NP the telescope)))) .)
