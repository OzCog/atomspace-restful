This directory contains a prototype implementation of Yuret's "lexical
attraction" algorithm for the discovery of synatctic links between
words in a sentence [Yuret 1998]. The goal of this algorithm is to 
provide a score for ranking the output of the link-grammar parser.

So far, nothing has been implemented; this is a pre-prototype.


Data Structures
---------------
The Yuret algorithm requires, as input, the mutual information between
pairs of words. Computing the mutal information requires performing a
statistical analysis on a large corpus of sentences. The statistical 
analysis needs to maintain four counts:
-- n(x,y) = the number of times a word pair was observed
-- n(x,*) = the number of times a word occured as the left element of a
            word pair
-- n(*,y) = the number of times a word occured as the right element of
            a word pair
-- n(*,*) = N = the number of word pairs observed.

The joint probability of seeing a word pair (x,y) is then

  p(x,y) = n(x,y) / n(*,*)

The marginal probabilities of seeing a word on the left, or right,
respectively, are

  p(x,*) = n(x,*) / n(*,*)
  p(*,y) = n(*,y) / n(*,*)

The "lexical attraction" is defined by Yuret as [chapter 4, page 40]:

   LA(x,y) = log_2 p(x,y) / (p(x,*) p(*,y))

Yuret calls this the "mutual information" for the word pair; however, 
this usage, while in a certain sense is correct, is also in conflict
with the common definition of mutual information as the expectation
value of LA; that is, as:

  MI(x,y) = E[LA(x,y)] = p(x,y) LA(x,y)

See for example, wikipedia "mutual information" or [Ash, Chapter 1.5]




Misc comments
-------------

A classic parse-ranking example is given in the following sentence.
Both parses are more or less legitimate, and have valid interpretations.

(S (NP I) (VP saw (NP the man) (PP with (NP the telescope))) .)

(S (NP I) (VP saw (NP (NP the man) (PP with (NP the telescope)))) .)
