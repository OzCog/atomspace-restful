This directory contains a miscellany of natural language processing
tools (for the English language). Current focus is on word sense
disambiguation.

The lexical-attraction directory contains a (pre-protype) implementation
of Yuret's lexical attraction algorithm.

The semcor directory contains some trite SemCor utilities. SemCor
is a WSJ corpus marked up with word senses.

The similarity directory contains code related to similarity.

The wordnet-import directory contains stand-alone code (i.e. not a part
of opencog) that will walk over the wordnet database, and convert it 
into OpenCog NMXML that can be leaded into opencog.

The wsd directory contains code that implements the Rada Mihalcea 
word-sense disambiguation algorithm.  The Mihalcea algorithm assigns
senses to the words in a sentence, and constructs links between these
different senses. The links are weighted by a word-sense similarity
measure. The result is a graph whose vertices are word-senses, and 
whose edges are these links.  The graph is essentially just a Markov 
chain, and is solved as such, looking for a stationary vector of 
probabilities for the word-sense verticies. The verticies with the 
highest scores are then the most likely meaning for a word.
