This directory contains code pertaining to word similarity measures.
The similarity measures are in part driven by statistical corpus
analysis.

Word Lemmas
-----------
Basic statistical information gathered from corpus analysis always
involves the frequency of words themselves, whereas for tasks such as
word similarity, one is interested in having the lemma of the form.
Thus, the goal is to represent the linkage between a word and its lemma.
