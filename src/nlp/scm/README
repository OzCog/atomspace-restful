Currently, the primary focus of work in this directory is to update
a database of statistics based on running word-sense disambiguation
together with parse results. This is implemented in stats-collection.scm.

The actual SQL tables are defined and created by a different project 
(sorry!), the 'lexical attraction' package on launchpad.  See, in
particular, src/sql/disjunct.sql from that package.

 * nlp-utils: some mini nlp-related utilities, mostly for pointer 
   chasing nlp-specific structures.

 * stats-collection.scm: look for documents for which word-sense
   disambiguation has been performed; use these to update a database
   of statistics that associates link-grammar parses with wsd results.

 * parse-rank.scm: tweak link-grammar parse-ranking scores, based
   on the mutual information contained in word pairs. (Not currently
   used)

 * disjunct.scm: build lists of link-grammar disjuncts.
